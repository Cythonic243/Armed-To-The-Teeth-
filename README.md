# Armed-To-The-Teeth
Time period is futuristic, 2080-2100 but also dystopian in a way. Dentists have to use slightly crude, steampunk style tools because the new tech is wildly expensive. Though some newer stuff can be found on the black market, it tends to be unreliable.

The world is high tech mostly, with large skyscrapers plastered with billboards and neon signs. Robotics and cyborgs are common, being that technology has advanced so far in such a short amount of time. However, most of the population is crammed together in large apartment buildings, thus people usually operate their businesses out of the ground floor of the apartments, meaning that clients are people that the business owner sees every day

Game takes place in the main character's apartment building, in downtown New york. The main character operates their dentist office out of the ground floor of the building, so most of the people they have as clients are people that they see daily.

This game is based off of the Cliche Armed to the teeth for the Gameoff2022 Gamejam!
